The files contain the problem statement, test codes including netlists and the jupyter file with the solution code.
Note that the code has been done in a limited timeframe and has scope for optimization and cleanup.
Week2 : Made a Matrix equation solver(Gaussian Elimination) that can read netlists from LTspice and analyze them.
Week3 : Curve fitting using curve_fit and least squares method
Week4:  Solving combinational digital circuits from netlists using topological ordered evaluation and event-driven simulation (using queues) and comparing their efficiency.
Week5:  Created an animation using FuncAnimation(matplotlib) that morphs any polygon into another polygon.
Week6: 	Program that performs function optimization using gradient descent and plots the optimum points.
Week7: 	Program that gives an optimal solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem using simulated annealing.
